    <font size="5">One foggy October day, the world was presented with a looming terror. That horrific beast came in the form of an eager child that immediately started crying upon entering this world. Little did humanity know, however, that upon growing up, the baby would become an utter menace; not a man, woman, or child would be spared. But that's enough about my brother. I was born in November.</font>
