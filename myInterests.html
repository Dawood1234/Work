    <font size="5">Although I am a teenager, I have no interest in sports. I do, however, enjoy video games, reading, and writing. I find that writing is a cathartic experience, as it allows you to express your views in a formal way without any pressure for time. Reading really depends on <i>what</i> you're reading, though.</font>
